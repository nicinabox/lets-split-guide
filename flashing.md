This guide covers flashing with OSX and Linux. If you're using Windows head over to [/u/CampAsAChamp's Windows Guide](https://github.com/CampAsAChamp/LetsSplitWindowsGuide) for this part.

## Prerequisites

Install avrdude

### OSX

```
$ brew install avrdude
```

### Ubuntu

```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:pmjdebruijn/avrdude-release
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install avrdude
```

### Raspberry Pi

```
echo "deb http://apt.adafruit.com/raspbian/ jessie main" | sudo tee --append /etc/apt/sources.list
wget -O - -q https://apt.adafruit.com/apt.adafruit.com.gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install avrdude dfu-programmer gcc-avr avr-libc
```

### Other Linux flavors

Probably google it, but feel free to open a PR if you'd like to expand this section.

## Which side do I flash?

Both sides must be flashed. They may optionally be connected when flashing, but you'll still need to plug the USB into each side and flash it.

## Choose which side you want to plug the USB cable into (choose a master side)

### Left side as master

This is the default. No extra configuration is needed.

### Right side as master

Add a `config.h` file to your keymap directory if it doesn't exist then add this flag to it:

```c
#define MASTER_RIGHT
```

### Either side as master

Add a `config.h` file to your keymap directory if it doesn't exist then add this flag to it:

```c
#define EE_HANDS
```

Now flash the eeprom on each side:

Left side:

```
avrdude -p atmega32u4 -P $(COM_PORT) -c avr109 -U eeprom:w:eeprom-lefthand.eep
```

Right side:

```
avrdude -p atmega32u4 -P $(COM_PORT) -c avr109 -U eeprom:w:eeprom-righthand.eep
```

NOTE: replace `$(COM_PORT)` with the port of your device (e.g. `/dev/ttyACM0`)

## Build Keymap (QMK)

From the qmk_firmware directory:

```
make lets_split-rev2-YOUR_KEYMAP_NAME-avrdude
```

Don't forget to replace `YOUR_KEYMAP_NAME` with the actual name of your keymap.

You'll now have a .hex file that we can use to flash.

## Bootloader

Connect RST and GND to enter bootloader. If you're using an official Sparkfun Pro Micro (the red one) you need to short this twice quickly.

You will have 8 seconds to flash before it continues on to the sketch.

> Tip: If this is the first time the Pro Micro has been flashed it should go directly to the bootloader on start.

## Flash

QMK now includes a very easy way to automatically find the serial port and flash without having to race the bootloader. From the qmk directory type (`$` indicates the prompt. Don't type that):

```
$ make lets_split-rev2-YOUR_KEYMAP_NAME-avrdude
```

Be sure to replace `YOUR_KEYMAP_NAME` with the name of your keymap.

Example:

```bash
$ make lets_split-rev2-YOUR_KEYMAP_NAME-avrdude
Reset your Pro Micro now

Connecting to programmer: .
Found programmer: Id = "CATERIN"; type = S
    Software Version = 1.0; No Hardware Version given.
Programmer supports auto addr increment.
Programmer supports buffered memory access with buffersize=128 bytes.

# [snip]

avrdude: verifying ...
avrdude: 22286 bytes of flash verified

avrdude: safemode: Fuses OK (E:CB, H:D8, L:FF)

avrdude done.  Thank you.
```

## Troubleshooting

### Programmer not responding

The controller isn't in bootloader mode. You may have missed the 8 second window to flash.

### Can't open device

The serial port you specified isn't the one the controller is using.

### Your right side has the TRRS on the LEFT and the keymap is reversed

As of Feb 7, 2017 this should no longer be necessary. The default `rev2` orientation matches the keymap below.

You need to flip the keymap in QMK to match the orientation of your board. If you have the right side setup with the TRRS on the left you'll need to reverse the keymap for that side.

Add a new file to your keymap directory named `flip_keymap.h`:
```
#undef KEYMAP
#define KEYMAP( \
	k00, k01, k02, k03, k04, k05, k45, k44, k43, k42, k41, k40, \
  k10, k11, k12, k13, k14, k15, k55, k54, k53, k52, k51, k50, \
  k20, k21, k22, k23, k24, k25, k65, k64, k63, k62, k61, k60, \
  k30, k31, k32, k33, k34, k35, k75, k74, k73, k72, k71, k70 \
	) \
	{ \
		{ k00, k01, k02, k03, k04, k05 }, \
		{ k10, k11, k12, k13, k14, k15 }, \
		{ k20, k21, k22, k23, k24, k25 }, \
		{ k30, k31, k32, k33, k34, k35 }, \
		{ k40, k41, k42, k43, k44, k45 }, \
		{ k50, k51, k52, k53, k54, k55 }, \
		{ k60, k61, k62, k63, k64, k65 }, \
		{ k70, k71, k72, k73, k74, k75 } \
	}
```

Then include this file at the top of `keymap.c` under `#include "lets_split.h"`:

```
#include "flip_keymap.h"
```

### Your right side has the TRRS on the RIGHT and the keymap is reversed

Use `rev2fliphalf` instead of `rev2` as the target.
