## History

The let's split v2 PCBs were [sold in Dec 2016](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/5gbp3l/buying_lets_split_40_pcbs_from_uwootpatoot/) by [switchtop](http://www.switchtop.com/product/let-s-split-40-percent-pcb) for $10/pair. They were black. Since then, they sold out quickly, and were [restocked once](https://www.reddit.com/r/mechmarket/comments/5l3ds5/vendor_lets_split_40_pcbs_restocked_at_switchtop/).
