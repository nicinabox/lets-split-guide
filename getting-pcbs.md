## Ordering PCBs using Gerber files

- Navigate to the [zipped gerber files](https://github.com/climbalima/let-s-Split-v2/blob/master/lets_split/lets%20split/lets%20split.zip) and click DOWNLOAD
- Select the PCB manufacturer based on price using [PCBShopper](http://pcbshopper.com/) or [read more about your options](https://www.reddit.com/r/electronics/wiki/pcb-manufacturers)
- if asked, this is a 2 layer board and the size of the PCB is 112.3mm x 79.2mm (4.42in x 3.12in)
- for most cases the default options (color usually defaults to green) is what you want

## History

The let's split v2 PCBs were [sold in Dec 2016](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/5gbp3l/buying_lets_split_40_pcbs_from_uwootpatoot/) by [switchtop](http://www.switchtop.com/product/let-s-split-40-percent-pcb) for $10/pair. They were black. Since then, they sold out quickly, and were [restocked once](https://www.reddit.com/r/mechmarket/comments/5l3ds5/vendor_lets_split_40_pcbs_restocked_at_switchtop/).
