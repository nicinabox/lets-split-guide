## Ordering PCBs using Gerber files

- Navigate to the [zipped gerber files](https://github.com/climbalima/let-s-Split-v2/blob/master/lets_split/lets%20split/lets%20split.zip) and click DOWNLOAD
- Select the PCB manufacturer based on price using [PCBShopper](http://pcbshopper.com/) or [read more about your options](https://www.reddit.com/r/electronics/wiki/pcb-manufacturers)
- if asked, this is a 2 layer board and the size of the PCB is 112.3mm x 79.2mm (4.42in x 3.12in) for the V2, and 114.25mm x 82mm for the socket version.
- for most cases the default options (color usually defaults to green) is what you want, as it's the cheapest.
- PCB thickness should be 1.6mm
- Surface finish can be anything they offer, usually leaded HASL is cheapest, meaning Hot Air Solder Leveled, and leaded meaing they've used leaded solder. 

## History

The let's split v2 PCBs were [sold in Dec 2016](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/5gbp3l/buying_lets_split_40_pcbs_from_uwootpatoot/) by [switchtop](http://www.switchtop.com/product/let-s-split-40-percent-pcb) for $10/pair. They were black. Since then, they sold out quickly, and were [restocked once](https://www.reddit.com/r/mechmarket/comments/5l3ds5/vendor_lets_split_40_pcbs_restocked_at_switchtop/).

The Let's split socket PCBs were [sold in a groupbuy](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/7cu03j/interest_check_update_lets_split_kailh_socket/) by SmuttenDK in Nov 2017 for $30/pair including connectors, sockets and diodes.
